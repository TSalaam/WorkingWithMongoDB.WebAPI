# Working with MongoDB in ASP.NET Core
We will be building a WebAPI Project that can manage customer data. Along the way we will cover various concepts including Introduction to NoSQL Database, What is MongoDB, Installing MongoDB Locally and on the Cloud, Integrating with ASP.NET Core and much more. In general, you will be getting a complete working knowledge with MongoDB and probably set enough to start implementing MongoDB in your next ASP.NET Core Project.
